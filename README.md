## Overview

We'll meet Monday through Thursday from 7-9 PM Eastern Time (ET). Each day is split into two 50-minute sessions, with a 10-minute break in between.

|| Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Week 1** | July 1 | July 2 | July 3 | July 4 | - |
|**Week 2**| July 8 | July 9 | July 10  | July 11  | - |

The lectures will cover, among other things, how to build a message board application end to end, from the frontend to the backend.

You can further strengthen your fundamental knowledge following the lecture with the following list of suggested tutorials and exercises. Feel free to write down anything you don't understand so you can ask later in another meeting or on the Discord server.

If you have found value from the bootcamp, please consider [making a donation/tip](https://linktr.ee/nbktechworld).

Note that the goal of the bootcamp is to expose you and guide you through the technologies. No one becomes a master from night to day. No one can magically make you a professional software developer in just a couple of days. It is up to you, and you only, to keep on studying and practicing on your own and being consistent at it, so you can become a master of your own.

## Day 8 - React Native

### Before we meet

- [ ] Have a smartphone with a camera.

### Notes

We recommend your smartphone be connected to the same WiFi network as your computer, so that the app can be loaded from your computer to the device. If that is not possible, you'll have to start the development server in tunnel mode. To do that, change the following line of the `package.json` file, including the `--tunnel` option:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "expo start --tunnel",
```
